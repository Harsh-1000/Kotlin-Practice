/**
 * Conceptually, async is just like launch. It starts a separate coroutine which is a light-weight thread
 * that works concurrently with all the other coroutines. The difference is that launch returns a Job and
 * does not carry any resulting value, while async returns a Deferred â€” a light-weight non-blocking future
 * that represents a promise to provide a result later.
 * You can use .await() on a deferred value to get its eventual result,
 * but Deferred is also a Job, so you can cancel it if needed.
